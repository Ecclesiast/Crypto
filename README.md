# Crypto
  My program is about encrypting, decoding and decrypting any message using different cyphers and approach.

To encrypt the text you need to choose the cypher write your message in the first textbox and the key in the second and then click "Encrypt". You can also save your key by clicking "Save".
If you want to decrypt your encrypted text you need to click "Decrypt"
